#### Get Started

The `ce30_viz` provides a set of tools to visualize CE30-D measurement data. All of these programs can be built and run on both Windows and Linux platforms. So far, we have tested them on Intel Core i7 PCs with 64-bit Windows 7, 64-bit Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64, separately. You can built from source codes after correctly installing all dependencies. Besides, we have pre-built binaries along with every release for Windows. Therefore, we recommend you downloading the latest binary at first when you are using Windows 7/10. If this does not work for you, you might have to build from source then.
